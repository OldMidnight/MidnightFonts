## Description
This module allows you to easily and systemless-ly switch fonts from a wide range of sources. No need to go to recovery as everything is done from your terminal. 

After flashing, type 'fonts' in a terminal to begin.

## Information
Flashing a new font on my device has always been a thing I did after rooting my device, but it was always something I would leave for 'later'. When I discovered fonts in the Magisk Manager I knew this would make it easier but it was still disparate. Multiple different fonts would each have a module and it seemed a wasted opportunity considering the flexibility of Magisk. so I made this. 
By using this module:
	* The need for multiple font zips on uour device is removed
	* The mod cleans up itself meaning after downloading and applying a font it deletes all related files
	* The option to locally store fonts is provided for those who want the option of switching fonts if no internet is available

#### Note:
* All fonts available in this module are all being hosted by me, so the font list will be maintained regularly and updated. Any font that hasnt been used in over a month will be removed. This rule will only apply after 50 fonts are available.
